# automatedEmail
A repository of an automated email sender that will send messages depending on occasion or day. This project makes use of datetime, csv, email.mime, random, and smtplib libraries to send emails to given users dependent on weekday or birthday
(such as sending random motivation quotes on Mondays). More functionality will be added to cover more occassions or days. This project also makes use of userpass class to hide sensitive email password information through the use of private
variable scope. The project contains a sample birthdays csv (that are not real), birthday letter txt templates used in sending emails, and a large txt file of motivational quotes that are sent on Mondays.
